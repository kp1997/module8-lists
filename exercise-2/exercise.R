# Exercise 2: `*apply()`

# Create a *list* of 10 random numbers. Use the `runif` function to make a vector of random numbers,
# then use `as.list()` to convert that to a list.
rand <- as.list(runif(10, 1, 10))

# Use `lapply()` to apply the `round()` function to each number, rounding it to the nearest .1
rand <- lapply(rand, round, .1)

## Bonus

# Create a variable 'sentence' that has contains a sentence of text (go for something longish).
# Make it lowercase
sentence <- tolower("i like pizza and french fries because they are delicios you dont say")

# Use the `strsplit()` function to split the sentence into vector of letters.
# Hint: split on `""` to split on everything
# Note: this will return a _list_ with 1 element (which is the vector of letters)
letters.list <- strsplit(sentence, "")

# Extract the vector of letters from the resulting list
letters <- letters.list[[1]]

# Use the `unique()` function to get a vector unique letters
uletters <- unique(letters)

# Define a function CountOccurances that takes in two parameters: a letter and a vector letters.
# The function should return how many times that letter occurs in the vector
# Hint: use a filter!
CountOccurances <- function(letter, vletters) {
  return(sum(letter == vletters))
}
# Call your CountOccurances() function to see how many times the letter 'e' is in your sentence.
CountOccurances('o', letters)

# Use `sapply()` to apply your CountOccurances() function to each unique letter in the vector to determine its frequency!
# Convert the result into a list (using `as.list`).
occ.list <- sapply(uletters, CountOccurances, letters)

# Print the resulting list of frequencies
print(occ.list)
